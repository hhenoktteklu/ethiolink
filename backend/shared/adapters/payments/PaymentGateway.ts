// EthioLink — payment gateway port.
//
// The booking service talks to payments exclusively through this
// interface. MVP ships two implementations:
//
//   * `CashGateway` — no-op success; cash settles in person at the
//     appointment.
//   * `MockOnlineGateway` — refuses every call with a typed error
//     because the real online providers are post-MVP.
//
// Future providers (Telebirr, Chapa, CBE Birr) plug in here by adding
// a class that implements `PaymentGateway`. The `PaymentProvider` enum
// — kept in sync with the `payment_intents.provider` CHECK list in
// migration 0011 — is the only schema-coupled identifier in this
// module.
//
// Design notes:
//   * **One method, `authorize`, in MVP.** Real online providers (and
//     a future capture/refund flow) will extend this surface — likely
//     with a `confirm(providerRef)` called from a webhook handler and
//     a `refund(providerRef, amount)` for admin overrides. None of
//     that is needed for cash, and modeling it now would be guesswork.
//     The interface stays narrow until a real call site demands more.
//   * **Result vs. throw split.** A regular "the user's card was
//     declined" outcome returns a `FAILED` result so the booking
//     service can persist a `payment_intents` row with the failure
//     reason. A "this gateway cannot service this request at all"
//     outcome — e.g. online payments are not yet implemented —
//     throws a typed `PaymentGatewayError` subclass. The booking
//     service distinguishes the two: declined → 200 with a domain
//     payload, unavailable → 400 with `ONLINE_PAYMENTS_UNAVAILABLE`.
//   * **No DB coupling.** This module imports nothing from the
//     repository layer. The booking service is responsible for
//     translating the returned `PaymentAuthorization` into a
//     `payment_intents` row (or, for `CASH`, skipping the write
//     entirely per the schema doc).
//   * **Idempotency.** `idempotencyKey` is part of the input so
//     future online providers can safely retry without
//     double-charging. Cash ignores it; MockOnline never reaches the
//     "would have used it" branch.
