# EthioLink Backend

AWS Lambda + API Gateway + RDS PostgreSQL. Node.js 20, TypeScript.

## Layout

```
backend/
  lambdas/    Lambda handlers (entrypoints — thin)
  api/        OpenAPI document
  db/
    migrations/   Forward-only SQL migrations
    seeds/        Seed data (categories, etc.)
  shared/
    config/         loadConfig()
    logging/        structured logger
    db/             pg client + base repository
    adapters/       AWS adapters (auth, storage, payments, notifications)
    domains/        domain services and repositories
  tests/      unit + integration tests
```

## Current state (Phase 1, in progress)

`npm run db:migrate` is real (see `db/migrate.mjs`). `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run lint` are still Phase 0 placeholders — those land later in Phase 1.

## Running locally

Prerequisites: Docker, Node.js 20+, and a clone of this repo.

1. Start Postgres in the background:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This is the `docker-compose.yml` at the project root, not under `backend/`. It listens on `localhost:5432` with database `ethiolink` and user/password `ethiolink`/`ethiolink`.

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Apply migrations:

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

   Default connection parameters match docker-compose — no `.env` file is required for the happy path. To point at a different database, set the matching `PG_*` env vars before running (see `backend/.env.example`). The runner tracks applied migrations in a `schema_migrations` table; re-running is a no-op when nothing is new.

To wipe the local database and start over:

```bash
docker-compose down -v   # drops the data volume
docker-compose up -d
npm run db:migrate
```
